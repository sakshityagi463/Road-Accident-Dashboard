# Problem Statement 
# Overview

The task at hand is to create a Road Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022, using a dataset containing information about road accidents in the UK. The client has specific requirements to gain insights into various aspects of road safety.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The primary focus is on understanding the impact of accidents, measured by the total number of casualties. Additionally, the client is interested in the distribution of casualties based on accident severity and the identification of vehicle types associated with the maximum casualties.

## Secondary KPIs
To delve deeper into the data, the client wants to analyze the total casualties with respect to different vehicle types. This provides a more detailed perspective on the types of vehicles contributing to road accidents.

## Monthly Trends
Comparing the monthly trends in casualties between the current year and the previous year is crucial for identifying patterns and variations over time. This allows the client to spot any significant changes in road safety.

## Maximum Casualties by Road Type
Understanding which road types are associated with the highest casualties is vital. This information helps in pinpointing specific areas that might need additional safety measures or interventions.

## Distribution by Road Surface
Analyzing the distribution of total casualties based on road surface provides insights into the role road conditions play in accidents. This can guide decisions on road maintenance and improvement.

## Relation Between Casualties and Location/Time
Examining the relationship between casualties and factors like the area or location of the accident, as well as whether it occurred during the day or night, helps in understanding the context of accidents.
